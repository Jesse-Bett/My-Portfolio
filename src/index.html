          <p id = "paragraph">I'm a software developer whose primary goal is to apply technical expertise all throughout the full software life cycle to ensure  the  production and delivery  of world-class products and services that meet client specifications. Along with a competent software developing team, and with strong personal knowledge,  skills,  and experience  in  software engineering, I am positive that this goal can be achieved. My experience as a junior software developer enhanced my abilities in designing,implementing, testing, and upgrading software. One of my objectives is to keep
  updated with the latest tech trends. I am confident that
   if given the opportunity, I can be a useful talent to the company.</p>
